# Description of your website, including:
- Purpose
    - We've been approached by Netflix to create an application that will reduce the time of users scrolling through their library and to make a decision quicker on which media to consume. The aim of the application will be to allow users to create watchlists, compare with their friends watchlists and to have a randomizer pick a choice to watch for them. Ultimately, this will lead to increased watching time as it reduces the friction of decision making especially if there are multiple parties involved, a very common issue with people in relationships deciding on what to watch. Having the data on what people are placing in their watchlists will allow Netflix to more accurately decide what content to include in their library and which licences to extend and which licences to forgo.
